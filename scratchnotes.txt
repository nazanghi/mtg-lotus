For now I'm going to use this as a to-do list

Need to clean up Decks to have add/remove/update in profile 

Add a way to select a deck for cards to be added to

Clean up CSS

Diagnose error in DeckController>GetAllDecks 

props.history.push(request.params.deck_id)

gotta grab the deck Id to then pass on for when I need to add cards to it
