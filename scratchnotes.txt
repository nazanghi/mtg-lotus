For now I'm going to use this as a to-do list


Add multiple functions to Cart Controller
Review MTGCardController and DeckController to ensure I have all necessary functions
Add Services relevant to MTGCard and Deck

Currently thinking I should eliminate Cart
    And make "export to TCG" and "export to MTGA" options


Add the readme


Thread the third party API to replace the seed.js



Add a shuffle function (this is stretch at this point, but not impossible)
